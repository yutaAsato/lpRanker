## Development

Clone this repository then run these commands in terminal:

```sh
npm install (installs dependencies)

npm run dev (starts the development server)
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

`main` is the master branch, create a branch off `main` eg `feat/new-feature` :

```sh
git checkout -b feat/new-feature
```

Push changes to repo then create pull request to `main`
